Events are actions that occur in the browser. Events are the actions performed on HTML elements by the user. For Ex, when the user clicks on a link, the browser sends an event to the server. The server can take some action based on the event.

Handling events

Each event in javascript has something that is constantly looking for that event to occur which is called event listener.
The event lisener triggers a function execution whenever the event occurs.
1. using the adddEventListener() method.
2. using the on attribute. for example onclick, onmouseover etc.

1. using the addEventListener() method
The addEventListener() method is used to add an event listener to an element. The addEventListener() method takes 2 arguments.

event	-	The event that is being listened for.
listener	-	The function that is called when the event occurs.

The event argument is the name of the event that is being listened to. The listener argument is the function that is called when the event occurs.
The addEventListener() method returns the listener argument.


2. using the on attribute
using the on attribute method you can directly add an event listener to the HTML element. 
Ex of attributes are onclick, onmouseover, etc.


Remove Event Listener
To remove an event listener from an element, you can use the removeEventListener() method.
It takes 2 arguments.
1. event
2. listener
